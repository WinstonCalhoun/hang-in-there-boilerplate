# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a poster generator.  
                    The Features Include: 
-A random poster option that uses a pre-generated list of images, titles, and quotes. 
-A poster option that allows the user to input their own image URL, title, and quote to create their own poster.
-A saved poster section if the user wants to save any random generated poster or a poster of their own creation.
-Ability to add and remove posters from the saved poster section.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals were to properly use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to produce a working application.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
The wins we have are that the application works the way we expected too.  the challenges were getting some of the events to properly form and getting help from mentors, and other students, helped us overcome those problems.  Sometimes you just have to say the problme outloud to someone else and you figure it out for yourself.
